# Welcome to the Python Course for Beginners

This course contains a set of useful and straightforward exercises designed to help you develop your algorithmic thinking and Python skills. It was designed to support the learning process of level 5 IT students of Whitecliffe college. The course covers exercises related to input/output, variables, if-else statements, loops, lists, strings, and the foundations of Object-Oriented Programming.

Some exercises were sourced from both Russian and English educational resources (Many thanks!). Others were generated by ChatGPT (Many-many thanks!). Additionally, some exercises are my own creations. In class, these exercises follow a brief lecture on the corresponding topic. Please take a look at w3Schools for more information.
